# testingtesting repository .gitignore
# Goal: ignore non-Python and non-SQL files (data, notebooks, binaries, builds, IDE artifacts)

# --- Keep Python and SQL files tracked ---
# We do not ignore *.py or *.sql files; do not add patterns that would exclude them.

# --- Empty file extension ---
*.

# --- Jupyter / notebooks ---
*.ipynb
*.ipynb_checkpoints/

# --- Data files (common large data formats) ---
*.csv
*.tsv
*.jsonl
*.ndjson
*.parquet
*.feather
*.avro
*.xlsx
*.xls
*.db
*.sqlite
*.sqlite3

# Exclude large raw exports or test fixtures that are typically not source

# --- Jupyter checkpoint or other notebook artifacts ---

# --- Coverage and test artifacts ---

# --- Allow list (examples) ---
# If you have directories like 'sql/' or 'scripts/' with non-ignored files, ensure they are not matched by the patterns above.
